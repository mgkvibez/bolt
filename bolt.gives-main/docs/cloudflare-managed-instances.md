# Cloudflare Managed Instances (Experimental Blueprint)

Status: the app/runtime control plane is implemented and live in the `v3.0.9.3` release line. Public trial requests now require profile registration first, the private operator surface at `https://admin.bolt.gives` tracks registered clients, assigned instances, and operator actions, and active managed instances are refreshed from the current release SHA by the runtime rollout controller. Managed trial instances use the protected hosted `FREE` relay so users can code and preview without operator credentials being exposed to the browser.

This document describes the **real implementation path** for an experimental bolt.gives managed-instance service on Cloudflare.

## Goal

Allow a client to request a single managed bolt.gives workspace that:

- runs on Cloudflare
- is isolated per client
- is automatically updated from the `main` branch
- cannot be duplicated by the same client

## Platform choice

There are two different platform paths:

### Free experimental path

This is the only technically honest **no-cost** path:

- shared Cloudflare Worker / Pages / Workers Builds control plane
- shared runtime capacity
- one client / one managed workspace record
- automatic updates from `main`

### Future dedicated Pro path

The correct Cloudflare product for a dedicated `6 GiB` Node runtime is **Cloudflare Containers**, not Pages alone.

Managed instance sizing:

- preferred preset: `standard-2`
- effective resources: `1 vCPU`, `6 GiB` memory, `12 GB` disk

Control plane:

- Cloudflare Worker / Workers Builds
- D1 for tenancy and rollout state
- Durable Objects for provisioning locks and serialized rollout work

Reality check:

- Cloudflare Workers Free is limited to `128 MB` runtime memory.
- Workers Builds Free provides `8 GB` build memory, but that is build-time only.
- Cloudflare Containers `standard-2` is billed and does not have a free tier.

That means:

- **Free experimental** cannot be a dedicated `6 GiB` container per client.
- A dedicated `6 GiB` container belongs to the future **Pro** path, or to a subsidized operator-funded rollout.

## Required guarantees

1. One client / one instance

- A client may hold only one active managed instance.
- If the same client requests another instance, the API must return the existing instance instead of provisioning a new one.

2. Automatic provisioning

- A spawn request must be idempotent.
- The system must create the instance, register its route, and persist its metadata without operator hand-editing.

3. Automatic updates from git

- `main` is the source of truth.
- A git push to `main` rebuilds the control plane and the managed instance image.
- The rollout controller updates all active managed workspaces/instances to the new release SHA.

4. Transparent status

- Users must be able to see:
  - provisioning
  - active
  - updating
  - failed
  - suspended

## Proposed architecture

### 1. Spawn API / Runtime control plane

Shipped public/product surfaces:

- `/managed-instances`
- `POST /api/managed-instances/spawn`
- `GET /api/managed-instances/session`
- `POST /api/managed-instances/:slug/refresh`
- `POST /api/managed-instances/:slug/suspend`

Runtime control endpoints:

- `GET /runtime/managed-instances/config`
- `GET /runtime/managed-instances/session`
- `POST /runtime/managed-instances/spawn`
- `POST /runtime/managed-instances/:slug/refresh`
- `POST /runtime/managed-instances/:slug/suspend`

Responsibilities:

- validate caller identity
- enforce one-client / one-instance policy
- return the existing instance if one already exists
- enqueue new provisioning if the client has no instance yet

### 2. D1 tenancy registry

Future hardened path:

Use D1 as the authoritative registry for:

- client identity
- instance slug
- container id
- current git SHA
- status
- rollout history
- audit trail

The schema lives in:

- `docs/cloudflare-managed-instances.sql`

### 3. Durable Object provisioning lock

Provisioning must be serialized per client.

Use a Durable Object keyed by client identity so that:

- duplicate spawn requests do not create duplicate instances
- concurrent retries collapse into a single in-flight job
- rollout work for one instance stays ordered

### 4. Runtime

Free experimental:

- shared runtime services on Workers / Pages
- no guaranteed dedicated `6 GiB` runtime per client

Future Pro:

- each dedicated instance runs as a Cloudflare Container:
- Node runtime
- `standard-2` instance type
- isolated workspace/storage mount strategy
- versioned image tag tied to git SHA

### 5. Routing

Each client instance receives a deterministic subdomain, for example:

- `client-slug.instances.bolt.gives`

The control plane keeps route assignment in D1 and only exposes healthy instances.

### 6. Git-driven rollout controller

On every push to `main`:

- Cloudflare Git integration / Workers Builds rebuilds the control plane
- the container image is rebuilt and tagged with the new git SHA
- a rollout job enumerates active instances
- each active instance is updated to the new SHA
- rollout status is written to D1

## Identity model

One client / one instance requires a stable client key.

Recommended options:

- GitHub identity
- email magic-link identity
- billing account identity

Persist a normalized `client_key` and enforce uniqueness in D1.

Do not use raw email addresses as public identifiers.
Store a normalized hash for uniqueness checks where possible.

## Pricing / commercial positioning

Initial positioning:

- **Free experimental service**
- limited availability
- one managed workspace per client
- shared Cloudflare runtime, no guaranteed dedicated `6 GiB` container

If stable:

- keep a Free plan
- add a **Pro plan from `$12/month`**
- unlock more tools, higher limits, stronger support, and the dedicated `6 GiB` container path

This pricing is a product intention, not a billing implementation yet.

## Rollout phases

### v3.0.2

- document the architecture
- add tenancy schema
- align README / roadmap / changelog
- keep `main` as the update source of truth
- separate the free experimental shared-runtime path from the future dedicated `6 GiB` Pro path

### v3.0.7

- implement the spawn API / runtime control plane
- implement server-local managed-instance registry and event history
- enforce one-client / one-instance on claimed identity plus browser session ownership
- implement the free experimental shared-runtime control plane first
- implement 15-day expiry metadata
- implement chosen subdomain handling
- implement current-build rollout synchronization logic

### v3.0.9.3+

- Built-in web browsing is part of release validation: direct website URLs in build prompts are scraped into model context, and the browse sidecar relaunches stale Chromium handles before retrying a failed browse.

### v3.0.9.2+

- replace the server-local registry with D1 / durable locking for production scale
- live-enable Cloudflare provisioning everywhere operator credentials exist
- add operator dashboards and health checks
- add health-verified rollback and stronger rollout observability

## Risks to solve before public launch

1. Abuse control

- require a real client identity
- rate-limit spawn attempts
- reject duplicate active instances

2. Rollout safety

- updates must be health-checked before marking an instance current
- failed rollouts must support rollback to the previous SHA

3. Cost control

- free experimental instances must scale to zero when idle
- idle/suspended instance policy must be explicit

4. Observability

- every instance needs logs, rollout state, and health events
- operators need a single place to inspect failures

## Success criteria

- A client can request an instance and receive the same instance on retries.
- No client can hold more than one active managed instance.
- A push to `main` rolls out to all active instances automatically.
- Failed rollouts are visible and recoverable.
- The service remains operator-manageable without manual per-client hand work.
